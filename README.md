# Blockchain

Our project is an exploration into blockchain. We built a simple blockchain that stores messages
between each other to demonstrate concepts like proof-of-work.

There is a document at `description.md` that gives a brief explanation of several blockchain concepts
in easy to understand terms. The article document gives a full explanation of the project.
